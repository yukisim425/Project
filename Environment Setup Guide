### Environment Setup Guide

To ensure the reproducibility of this study, follow the detailed guide below to recreate the computational environment. You can use either Python's built-in `venv` module or `conda`.

---

#### 1. Using `venv` (Virtual Environment Tool):

1. **Create the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   Using the `requirements.txt` file provided, install all libraries and dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify the environment:**
   Check that all required libraries are installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

#### 2. Using `conda` (Conda Environment Tool):

1. **Create the Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create --name obesity_project python=3.10
   ```

2. **Activate the Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate obesity_project
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   Convert the `requirements.txt` file to a Conda-compatible format (if needed) or manually install the libraries:
   ```bash
   conda install --file requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify the environment:**
   List all installed packages and verify their versions:
   ```bash
   conda list
   ```

---

#### 3. Documenting the Environment:

After setting up the environment, export the exact dependencies and versions for future replication:

- For `venv`:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

- For `conda`:
  ```bash
  conda env export > environment.yml
  ```
